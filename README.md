## The course
In this repository you can find my code of the labs for the Machine Learning 1 course. This course, taught at the University of Amsterdam for the master AI programme, consists of multiple homework exercises and two computer labs. The first lab looks at linear regression and the Bayesian Linear Polynomial Regression. In the second computer lab we take a deeper dive into Gaussian Processes and Support Vector Machines.
